This repository shows why GitHub time stamps are unreliable for giving
assignment submission times.  Note that all of the time stamps shown
in this repository are January 1, 1989.  However, the files contained
in this repository were clearly uploaded after that date:
<ul>
  <li>
    GitHub was not launched until 2008.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    This file is in HTML format, but work on the HTML specification
    was not begun until 1990.
  </li>
  <li>
    The program contained in this repository is written in C#, whose
    development was not begun until 1999.
  </li>
  <li>
    The program displays Google's web page, but Google was not founded
    until 1998.
  </li>
</ul>
Creating these time stamps requires no sophisticated hacks.  The time
stamps are simply commit times, which are taken from the local
machine's clock.  A user can set a PC's clock to (somewhat) arbitrary
dates and times.
